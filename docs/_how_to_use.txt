The Documentation uses docsify.

https://docsify.js.org/

After installation you start a terminal in the folder with the documentation and run

docsify serve

It will create a local webserver at http://localhost:3000 where you can check out the preview of the pages.

The GitHub repository has been set up so that the Github Pages uses the subfolder /docs in the main branch to generate the static sites.
