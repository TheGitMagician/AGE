Hotspots: If two overlap, one is always "dominant" and reacts to Mouse Enter, even if your are still over the other one.
Can be okay if you know that hotspots should never overlap.

All functions have to react to repeatedly_execute_always calls - just like o_object's move() function does currently.

All functions should get a function in the beginning that initializes a struct with the necessary variables
as well as some internal initialization (e.g. the repeatedly_execute_always check).
They should also get a function in the end that destroys that struct and resets any internal variables.

Remember: TXR can access all structs and variables that are referenced in `o_age_main`.
